# HeavyweightUpdate

The Heavyweight Update sends a small mailing list a text when a new episode of Heavyweight comes out on Spotify. This keeps people who use other podcasting platforms from having to check the Spotify app for their Spotify-exclusive podcasts.

This script uses the Spotify API and Twilio for messaging services.
